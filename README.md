# 🎄 Advent of Code — 12 Days, 12 Languages

This repo is where I’m doing the 12-day Advent of Code, but with a twist:
I’m solving each day in a completely different programming language.

Why?
Because it’s actually a fun way to force myself to learn new languages without watching boring tutorials.

TLDR:

12 days → 12 languages → 12 new brain upgrades.

# 🛠 Languages I’m planning on using

I’m trying to mix low-level, high-level, and whatever looks fun that day:
C++
C
Python
Rust
Go
TypeScript
C#
Java
Lua
Zig
maybe Haskell 
maybe x86 Assembly

Not a strict order.  I’m just picking whatever feels right for the puzzle.

#⭐ Why I’m Doing It

Gets me used to swapping languages fast

I get to show languages I know other than C++ 

Good practice 

And honestly it just looks cool on GitHub

Also I actually want to finish all 12 days  😭
